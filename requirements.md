## Scope (In/Out)

### Out

- The application will not be able to tell you your real future.
- The application is for entertainment purposes only.


## Minimal Viable Product

The application will have a home page with a global and a input prompt that generates a random respose. It will have a about page with info about the authors, instructions on the site and general info about the site. It will also have a loading screen the will show each time the page is change.

## Stretch

- A stretch goal would be to add more intelligent answers base on the users response

- add text to speak for responses


## Functional Requirements

- The user will be able to enter in a question in a prompt and get a randomly generated response. The prompt should take in texted based inputs and submitting the question should bring up a random answer.

- The user will be able to recieve an answer in the prompt to cause the global to use location data to simulate a visual search for the answer to my question around the world. The visual search should be seen as lines going from location to location until an answer is generated.

- There will be an About page. This page should have the capability to scroll up and down displaying different info. The info on the screen should have an about section, instructions section, and a about the team section.

- The globe on the home page will be intractable. When I click and drag on the globe it should move with the mouse allowing me to see around the globe.

- A loading screen will show
when the user changes to different page. The
loading screen should have stars that move
and a “Traveling to earth” message moving across the screen
giving the illusion of traveling through space.

## Non-Funtional Requirements
